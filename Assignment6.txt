Data Preprocessing
1. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values:

Remove missing values: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are not significant.
Impute missing values: Fill missing values using mean, median, mode, or more advanced techniques like KNN imputation or regression imputation.
Handling Outliers:

Identify outliers: Use box plots, z-scores, or IQR methods.
Handle outliers: Remove them, cap them, or use transformation techniques to reduce their impact.
Correcting Errors:

Fix typos and inconsistencies: Standardize categorical variables, correct data entry errors, etc.
2. Data Transformation
Normalization and Standardization:

Normalization: Rescale features to a fixed range, usually [0, 1].
Standardization: Rescale features to have zero mean and unit variance.
Encoding Categorical Variables:

Label Encoding: Assign a unique number to each category.
One-Hot Encoding: Create binary columns for each category.
Ordinal Encoding: Encode categories with meaningful order.
Scaling Numerical Features:

Use techniques like Min-Max scaling, Standard scaling, or Robust scaling to ensure numerical features are on a similar scale.
3. Data Reduction
Dimensionality Reduction:

Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, or UMAP to reduce the number of features while retaining essential information.
Feature Selection:

Select relevant features using methods like correlation analysis, mutual information, or recursive feature elimination (RFE).
Feature Engineering
1. Creating New Features
Date and Time Features:

Extract day, month, year, day of the week, hour, etc., from datetime columns.
Text Features:

Extract features like word count, character count, presence of specific keywords, etc., from text data.
Interaction Features:

Create new features by combining existing ones (e.g., product, ratio, difference).
2. Transformation of Existing Features
Polynomial Features:

Create polynomial combinations of numerical features.
Binning:

Convert continuous variables into categorical bins (e.g., age groups).
Log Transformation:

Apply log transformation to reduce skewness in distributions.
3. Aggregation and Grouping
Aggregated Features:
Create features by aggregating values (e.g., mean, sum, count) over specific groups or time windows.
4. Target Encoding
Encode categorical features by replacing each category with the mean of the target variable for that category.
